# Projection Architecture Analysis & Refactoring Plan

## Objective
Analyze and eliminate architectural redundancy in composite projection building logic across the codebase.

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Issue: Code Duplication
There are **two identical copies** of the standalone projection loader:

1. **Package**: `packages/projection-loader/`
   - Purpose: Standalone, publishable npm package (@atlas-composer/projection-loader)
   - Status: Built and ready (has dist/ folder with compiled outputs)
   - Files:
     - `src/standalone-projection-loader.ts` (628 lines)
     - `src/d3-projection-helpers.ts` (134 lines)
     - `src/index.ts` (exports)
   - Package: Published-ready with proper exports, MIT license, zero dependencies

2. **Services Copy**: `src/services/export/`
   - Purpose: Internal copy for export functionality
   - Status: Appears to be an exact duplicate
   - Files:
     - `standalone-projection-loader.ts` (616 lines - nearly identical)
     - `d3-projection-helpers.ts` (134 lines - identical)
     - `package.json` (separate package config!)
     - `examples/` folder with usage examples
     - `__tests__/` with test suite

### Key Findings

#### 1. **Package Already Exists and is Built**
- `@atlas-composer/projection-loader` is a proper workspace package
- Already integrated in build pipeline: `pnpm build:loader`
- Has compiled dist/ artifacts (index.js, d3-projection-helpers.js, .d.ts files)
- Properly configured exports in package.json

#### 2. **Duplicate Maintenance Burden**
- Any bug fix needs to be applied to both locations
- Type definitions duplicated
- Tests duplicated (`__tests__/standalone-projection-loader.spec.ts`)
- Documentation/examples duplicated

#### 3. **Different Projection Building Systems**
The codebase uses TWO different approaches to build composite projections:

**A. Runtime Projection (Main App)**
- Location: `src/services/projection/composite-projection.ts`
- Purpose: Interactive runtime projection building in the Vue app
- Features:
  - Direct D3 projection instantiation
  - Uses `ProjectionFactory` and `projectionRegistry` from `@/core/projections/`
  - Manual configuration via `CompositeProjectionConfig`
  - Supports dynamic parameter changes
  - Territory positioning, clipping, scaling
- Used by: Main application UI, MapRenderer, etc.

**B. Export/Import Projection (Standalone Loader)**
- Location: Both `packages/projection-loader/` AND `src/services/export/`
- Purpose: Zero-dependency loader for exported configurations
- Features:
  - Plugin architecture (register projections before use)
  - Zero dependencies (d3 not bundled)
  - Consumes JSON export configs
  - Tree-shakeable
- Used by: Code generation, exported configs, external consumers

#### 4. **Code Generator References**
`src/services/export/code-generator.ts` generates code that imports from:
```typescript
import { loadCompositeProjection, registerProjection } 
  from "@atlas-composer/projection-loader"
```
This is correct - it references the PACKAGE, not the services copy.

#### 5. **Architectural Confusion**
- `src/services/export/` has its own `package.json` - suggesting it was meant to be published separately?
- LICENSE file in services/export/ (duplicated from package)
- Examples folder in services/export/ (duplicated from package)

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Redundancy** (CRITICAL)
- ~760 lines of duplicated code (standalone-projection-loader + helpers)
- Duplicate tests
- Duplicate documentation
- Risk of divergence (one gets updated, other doesn't)

### 2. **Confusion** (MEDIUM)
- Two package.json files for the same functionality
- Unclear which copy is "source of truth"
- Services folder contains what looks like a separate package

### 3. **Import Inconsistency** (LOW)
- Internal code can import from either location
- Tests import from `../standalone-projection-loader` (services copy)
- Generated code imports from `@atlas-composer/projection-loader` (package)

## Recommended Architecture

### Single Source of Truth Strategy

```
packages/projection-loader/              ← CANONICAL SOURCE
├── src/
│   ├── standalone-projection-loader.ts  ← Core loader logic
│   ├── d3-projection-helpers.ts         ← D3 projection factories
│   └── index.ts                         ← Public exports
├── examples/                            ← Usage examples

└── config-migrator.ts                   ← Helper utilities

src/services/projection/                 ← RUNTIME SYSTEM (separate)
└── composite-projection.ts              ← Interactive projection building
    ↑ Uses: @/core/projections/factory, registry
    ↑ Purpose: Runtime UI manipulation, not export
```

### Clear Separation of Concerns

1. **`packages/projection-loader/`**: Standalone, zero-dependency, publishable
   - Consumer-facing API
   - JSON config loading
   - Plugin registration system
   - External users import this

2. **`src/services/projection/`**: Runtime projection system
   - Used by Vue app
   - Direct D3 manipulation
   - Interactive parameter adjustment
   - NOT exported

3. **`src/services/export/`**: Export/import services
   - Uses `@atlas-composer/projection-loader` as dependency
   - Code generation
   - Config serialization/deserialization
   - Migration utilities

## Affected Domains
- [ ] packages/projection-loader/ (docs/projections.llm.txt)
- [ ] src/services/export/ (docs/export.llm.txt, docs/services.llm.txt)
- [ ] docs/architecture.llm.txt (overall structure)

## Expected Benefits

### 1. **Single Source of Truth** (+++)
- One canonical implementation
- One place to fix bugs
- One place to add features
- One test suite to maintain

### 2. **Clear Architecture** (++)
- Package = External API
- Services = Internal consumers
- No confusion about which to import

### 3. **Reduced Maintenance** (+++)
- ~760 fewer lines to maintain
- Single test suite
- Single documentation source

### 4. **Better Developer Experience** (++)
- Clear import paths
- Obvious where to make changes
- Self-documenting architecture

### 5. **Proper Package Publishing** (+)

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Files Have Diverged
**Mitigation**: Phase 1 audit will catch this. If different, analyze differences before proceeding.

### Risk 2: Hidden Dependencies
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive import search in Phase 3. Typecheck will catch missing imports.

### Risk 3: Build Integration Issues
**Mitigation**: Package already building successfully. Verify with `pnpm build:loader`.

### Risk 4: Test Breakage
**Mitigation**: Move tests carefully, update paths incrementally, verify at each step.
