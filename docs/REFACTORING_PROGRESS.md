---

### Task 1.2: Extract AtlasPatternService ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completed:** October 10, 2025
**Priority:** HIGH
**Files Created:**
- [x] `src/services/atlas/atlas-pattern-service.ts`

---

### Task 1.3: Fix Cartographer Encapsulation ‚úÖ
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Completed:** October 10, 2025
**Priority:** HIGH
**Files Updated:**
- [x] `src/services/cartographer-service.ts` (added public getter)
- [x] `src/stores/geoData.ts` (removed `as any` casts)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] No `as any` casts in geoData store
- [x] Public API for accessing geoDataService
- [x] Type-safe access with null checks

**Implementation Details:**
- Added `get geoData()` public getter to Cartographer

- Added null checks for safety

---

### Task 1.4: Extract MapOverlayService ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Deferred (Low priority, complex extraction)
**Priority:** LOW (was HIGH - deprioritized)
**Files Created:**
