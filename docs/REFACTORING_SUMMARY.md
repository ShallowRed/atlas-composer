- All pattern checks now use service calls

---

### Phase 2: Data Layer (100%)

**Services Created:**
1. `TerritoryDataLoader` - Strategy pattern for data loading
2. `SingleFocusLoadStrategy` - Loading strategy for France, Portugal, USA
3. `EqualMembersLoadStrategy` - Loading strategy for EU, World
4. `TerritoryFilterService` - Territory filtering and grouping

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Data loading logic extracted from stores
- ✅ Strategy pattern for pattern-specific behavior
- ✅ Filtering logic separated and testable
- ✅ geoData store reduced by 87 lines (30%)

**Impact:**
- 2 service files created
- loadTerritoryData() simplified from ~60 to ~20 lines
- loadRawUnifiedData() simplified significantly
- filteredTerritories computed from ~30 to ~10 lines

---

### Phase 3: UI Layer (100%)

**Services Created:**
1. `ProjectionUIService` - Projection grouping and UI visibility
2. `MapSizeCalculator` - Map dimension calculations

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ All projection UI logic centralized
- ✅ 9 computed properties simplified to service calls
- ✅ Size calculations extracted with configurable defaults
- ✅ config store reduced by 55 lines (15%)
- ✅ MapRenderer reduced by 25 lines (4%)

**Impact:**
- 2 service files created
- 7 visibility methods for UI state management
- Fully configurable size calculation
- Removed projectionRegistry import from store

---

### Phase 4: Orchestration (100%)

**Services Created:**
1. `TerritoryDefaultsService` - Territory initialization logic
2. `AtlasCoordinator` - Atlas change orchestration

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ Initialization logic extracted and reusable
- ✅ Watch logic simplified from ~55 to ~15 lines (73% reduction)
- ✅ config store further reduced by 55 lines (18%)
- ✅ All complex orchestration testable without Vue

**Impact:**
- 2 service files created
- Watch logic now just applies coordinator updates
- Clean separation between state and orchestration
- Final config store: 246 lines (from 355, -31%)

## 🎓 Design Patterns Applied

1. **Strategy Pattern** - TerritoryDataLoader (SingleFocus vs EqualMembers)
2. **Service Layer** - All business logic in dedicated services
3. **Facade Pattern** - AtlasCoordinator simplifies complex operations
4. **Factory Pattern** - AtlasPatternService.fromPattern()
5. **Static Methods** - All services use static methods (easily testable)
6. **Single Responsibility** - Each service has one clear purpose

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| No `as any` casts in stores | ✅ | Removed all 2 instances |
| No business logic in computed | ✅ | All delegated to services |
| Services testable without Vue | ✅ | All use static methods |
| Stores < 200 lines | ⚠️ | geoData: 199 ✅, config: 246 (close) |
| Pattern detection centralized | ✅ | 100% in AtlasPatternService |
| Components delegate to services | ✅ | MapRenderer, stores updated |

---

## 📈 Quality Improvements

### Before Refactoring
- ❌ Business logic scattered across stores and components
- ❌ Pattern checks duplicated throughout codebase
- ❌ Complex computed properties with inline logic
- ❌ Type casts breaking encapsulation
- ❌ 55-line watch logic in config store
- ❌ Hard to test without Vue context

### After Refactoring
- ✅ Business logic in dedicated, focused services
- ✅ Pattern detection centralized in one place
- ✅ Computed properties delegate to services
- ✅ Type-safe public APIs
- ✅ 15-line watch logic using coordinator
- ✅ All services testable without Vue

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Needed (Future Work)
1. `atlas-pattern-service.test.ts` - Pattern detection logic
2. `territory-data-loader.test.ts` - Strategy pattern loading
3. `territory-filter-service.test.ts` - Filtering logic
4. `projection-ui-service.test.ts` - UI visibility logic
5. `map-size-calculator.test.ts` - Size calculations
6. `territory-defaults-service.test.ts` - Initialization
7. `atlas-coordinator.test.ts` - Orchestration logic

**Target:** 80%+ test coverage on all services

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Review all changes
2. ✅ Test application functionality
3. ✅ Verify all atlases work correctly
4. ✅ Check for any regressions

### Short Term
1. Add unit tests for all services
2. Add integration tests for critical paths
3. Update developer documentation
4. Create service layer guide

### Long Term
1. Consider extracting MapOverlayService (Task 1.4 - deferred)
2. Add more pattern behaviors to AtlasPatternService as needed
3. Optimize performance if needed
4. Continue iterating on architecture
