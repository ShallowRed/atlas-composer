# TODO List

## Important :
- fix portugal and usa default presets
-  We should group territory tags in TerritorySetManager according to atlas defined groups. Lets also keep them at the same place wether they are active or inactive, to avoid layout shifts when toggling them.

## Nice to have :
- improve test coverage (in both direction, make sure we don't miss anything, and remove useless tests)
- new feature : add a zoomed inset in composition
- new feature : a two way converter between d3-composite-projections and json presets
- new feature : usage with mapbox, leaflet, etc.
