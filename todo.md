# TODO List

## Important :
- show composition borders for mainland
- make sure to select a composite projection from drowpdown when switching to existing composition projection mode
- fix portugal and usa default presets
- move configs at root of config/ to config/atlases/
- better handling of non matching list of territories in presets vs atlas config :
  - make custom projection preset tied to a specific set of territories

## Nice to have :
- improve test coverage (in both direction, make sure we don't miss anything, and remove useless tests)
- new feature : add a zoomed inset in composition
