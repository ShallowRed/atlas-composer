# TODO List

## Important :
- fix portugal and usa default presets
- we should handle mismatching list of territories in presets vs atlas config better, and make custom projection preset tied to a specific set of territories

## Nice to have :
- improve test coverage (in both direction, make sure we don't miss anything, and remove useless tests)
- new feature : add a zoomed inset in composition
- new feature : a two way converter between d3-composite-projections and json presets
- new feature : usage with mapbox, leaflet, etc.
