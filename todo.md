# TODO List

## Important :
- make sure to select a composite projection from drowpdown when switching to existing composition projection mode
- fix portugal and usa default presets
- move configs at root of config/ to config/atlases/
- we should handle mismatching list of territories in presets vs atlas config better, and make custom projection preset tied to a specific set of territories

## Nice to have :
- improve test coverage (in both direction, make sure we don't miss anything, and remove useless tests)
- new feature : add a zoomed inset in composition
