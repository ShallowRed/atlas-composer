# Phase 2 Improvements - Implementation Plan

## Objective
Improve and finalize the Phase 2 code generation system to ensure the generated code works correctly with the `@atlas-composer/projection-loader` package and prepare the package for potential NPM publication.

## Affected Domains
- [ ] Export System (docs/export.llm.txt) - Code generation improvements
- [ ] Architecture (docs/architecture.llm.txt) - If structural changes needed
- [ ] Composite Projection Exporter (docs/composite-projection-exporter.llm.txt) - Phase 2 status updates

## Context
- Architecture: docs/architecture.llm.txt
- Export System: docs/export.llm.txt
- Composite Exporter: docs/composite-projection-exporter.llm.txt

## Changes

### Phase 1: Package Preparation and Fixes âœ…
- [x] File: src/services/export/composite-export-service.ts
  - Action: Fix TODO - Import version from package.json instead of hardcoded string
  - Why: Maintain single source of truth for version numbers
  - Done: Imports from package.json with fallback to v1.0 for dev version

- [x] File: packages/projection-loader/package.json
  - Action: Verify package.json configuration is correct for publication
  - Why: Ensure package can be published to NPM or used locally
  - Done: Configuration verified, properly set up with ESM exports

- [x] File: pnpm-workspace.yaml
  - Action: Verify workspace configuration includes projection-loader
  - Why: Ensure monorepo setup works correctly
  - Done: Workspace properly configured with projection-loader package

### Phase 2: Generated Code Validation
- [ ] File: Create test file to validate generated code actually works
  - Action: Create integration test that imports and runs generated code
  - Why: Ensure generated code is not just syntactically correct but functionally correct

- [ ] File: src/services/export/__tests__/code-generator.spec.ts
  - Action: Add test that checks generated imports match package exports
  - Why: Prevent mismatch between generated code and actual package API

### Phase 3: Documentation Updates
- [ ] File: packages/projection-loader/README.md
  - Action: Verify README matches current implementation
  - Why: Ensure users have accurate documentation

- [ ] File: docs/export.llm.txt
  - Action: Update with current state of projection-loader integration
  - Why: Keep documentation synchronized with implementation

- [ ] File: docs/composite-projection-exporter.llm.txt
  - Action: Update Phase 2 status if needed, remove temporal language
  - Why: Maintain reference documentation standards per critical rules

### Phase 4: Examples and Usage
- [ ] File: Add example usage in packages/projection-loader/examples/
  - Action: Create example that uses generated code from Atlas composer
  - Why: Demonstrate end-to-end workflow

## Documentation Updates (CRITICAL - See .github/copilot-critical-rules.md)
REMEMBER: .llm.txt files are STATIC REFERENCE docs
- Remove: "before/after", "resolved", "completed", dates, objectives, problems
- Keep: current state, how it works, what it does
- Use: present tense only ("handles", "provides", "uses")

- [ ] docs/export.llm.txt - Update projection-loader integration details (present tense)
- [ ] docs/composite-projection-exporter.llm.txt - Update Phase 2 implementation status (present tense)
- [ ] docs/architecture.llm.txt - Update if structural changes made (present tense)

## Verification
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests pass (if applicable)
- [ ] Generated code can be actually used (manual verification)
- [ ] All .llm.txt documentation updated (check with visual inspection)
- [ ] No temporal language in .llm.txt files
- [ ] Plan file marked complete

## Status
Status: PLANNED
