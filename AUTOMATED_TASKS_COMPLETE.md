## What's Next: Manual Testing

**16 Manual Testing Tasks Remain** (0/16 complete)

### Phase 2 - Integration Testing (5 tasks)
1. Load each atlas (France, Portugal, EU) in browser
2. Switch between view modes (composite-custom, composite-existing, split, unified)
3. Change projections in each mode
4. Verify territory controls work correctly
5. Fix any bugs discovered during testing

### Phase 3 - Atlas Configuration Testing (5 tasks)
1. Test config loading with projection preferences
2. Test atlas service methods
3. Verify recommended projections display correctly (★★★ badges)
4. Verify prohibited projections are filtered out
5. Test default projection initialization

### Phase 4 - UI Testing (6 tasks)
1. Test projection selector in all view modes
2. Test territory-specific recommendations
3. Test validation warnings and confirmation dialogs
4. Test UI on different screen sizes (responsive design)
5. Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
6. Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Phase 5 - Final Testing & PR Preparation (10 tasks)

**Testing** (4 tasks):
1. Run E2E tests (if available)
2. Performance testing (load time, projection switching speed)
3. Memory leak testing (browser dev tools)
4. Full manual testing cycle (all atlases, all modes, all projections)

**PR Preparation** (6 tasks):
1. Rebase on latest `main` branch
2. Resolve any merge conflicts
3. Squash/organize commits logically (currently 31 commits)
4. Write comprehensive PR description
5. Tag reviewers
6. Create demo video/screenshots for PR

## How to Begin Manual Testing

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Open in browser
# http://localhost:5174/

# Test systematically:
# 1. Load France atlas
# 2. Test all view modes (split, composite-custom, composite-existing, unified)
# 3. Change projections in each mode
# 4. Test search/filter functionality
# 5. Test recommendations and validation warnings
# 6. Repeat for Portugal and EU atlases
```
