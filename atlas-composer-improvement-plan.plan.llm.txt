# Atlas Composer - Comprehensive Improvement Plan

## Objective
Improve codebase maintainability, reduce technical debt, and enhance code quality through:
- Removing unnecessary/deprecated code
- Improving DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Better separation of concerns
- Consolidating patterns and reducing duplication

## Context
- Architecture: docs/architecture.llm.txt
- Vue Architecture: docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt
- Services: docs/services.llm.txt
- Test Coverage: 164 tests (100% passing)

## Analysis Summary

### Current State
**Strengths**:
- Well-structured service layer with clear patterns (instance vs static)
- Good composable architecture with focused responsibilities
- Strong type safety and test coverage
- Clear domain boundaries and documentation

**Areas for Improvement**:
1. **Code Duplication**: Repeated patterns across services and composables
2. **Configuration Complexity**: Multiple overlapping initialization patterns
3. **Store Coupling**: Some tight coupling between stores
4. **Legacy Code**: TODOs and deprecated patterns still present
5. **Component Complexity**: Some components have grown too large

## Affected Domains
- [x] Architecture (docs/architecture.llm.txt)
- [x] Services (docs/services.llm.txt)
- [x] Vue Architecture (docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt)
- [x] Stores (src/stores/)
- [x] Composables (src/composables/)
- [x] Components (src/components/)

## Changes

### Phase 1: Remove Deprecated/Unnecessary Code

#### 1.1: Clean up TODOs and deprecated code
- [x] File: src/components/ui/import/ImportControls.vue
  - Action: Implement or remove TODO comment about toast notifications
  - Why: Technical debt cleanup, improve code clarity
  - Line: 21 - `// TODO: Add toast notification for success`
  - Completed: Removed unnecessary comment

- [x] File: src/stores/config.ts
  - Action: Review and implement or remove TODO about global scale for composite-existing
  - Why: Clarify feature status or implement pending feature
  - Line: 544 - `// TODO: Apply global scale when composite-existing mode supports it`
  - Completed: Converted to clarifying comment explaining limitation

- [x] File: src/composables/useViewState.ts
  - Action: Remove or implement preset loading state tracking
  - Why: Clean up incomplete feature flag
  - Line: 107 - `isPresetLoading: false, // TODO: Track preset loading state`
  - Completed: Removed TODO comment

- [x] File: src/components/TerritoryControls.vue
  - Action: Remove commented code for shouldShowDragInfo or implement properly
  - Why: Remove dead code
  - Lines: 91-94
  - Completed: Removed commented code

#### 1.2: Remove relative path imports with too many levels
- [x] File: src/services/export/composite-export-service.ts
  - Action: Replace `import packageJson from '../../../package.json'` with vite alias
  - Why: Improve maintainability, use consistent import patterns
  - Current: `import packageJson from '../../../package.json'`
  - Proposed: Add alias in vite.config.ts and use `import packageJson from '#package'`
  - Completed: Added #package alias to vite.config.ts and src/tsconfig.json

### Phase 2: Improve DRY - Reduce Duplication

#### 2.1: Extract common atlas config access patterns
**Problem**: Multiple composables and components access `configStore.currentAtlasConfig` with similar patterns
**Solution**: Create centralized composable for atlas config access

- [x] File: src/composables/useAtlasConfig.ts (NEW)
  - Action: Create new composable to centralize atlas config access
  - Why: DRY - Eliminate repeated patterns
  - Completed: Created with currentAtlasConfig, atlasService, isAtlasLoaded, atlasId

- [x] Files to refactor: Use new `useAtlasConfig()` composable
  - src/composables/useTerritoryTransforms.ts
  - Action: Replace direct configStore.currentAtlasConfig access with useAtlasConfig()
  - Why: Consistent access pattern, easier to maintain
  - Completed: Integrated useAtlasConfig in useTerritoryTransforms

- [ ] Files to refactor (remaining):
  - src/composables/useViewState.ts
  - src/components/TerritoryControls.vue
  - Note: Can be completed in future iterations

#### 2.2: Consolidate parameter provider patterns
**Problem**: Parameter provider adapter code duplicated in multiple places
**Files**: src/stores/geoData.ts, src/components/ui/export/CompositeExportDialog.vue

- [x] File: src/composables/useParameterProvider.ts (NEW)
  - Action: Create reusable composable for parameter provider adapter
  - Why: DRY - Single implementation for parameter provider pattern
  - Completed: Created with getEffectiveParameters and getExportableParameters

- [x] Files to refactor:
  - src/components/ui/export/CompositeExportDialog.vue
  - Action: Replace inline parameter provider with useParameterProvider()
  - Why: Single source of truth for parameter provider logic
  - Completed: Integrated useParameterProvider composable
  
- [ ] Files to refactor (remaining):
  - src/stores/geoData.ts (kept as-is since composables can't be used in stores)
  - Note: Store implementation uses inline pattern which is acceptable

#### 2.3: Extract code generation utilities
**Problem**: Code generator has duplicate patterns for D3 JavaScript and TypeScript generation
**File**: src/services/export/code-generator.ts

- [ ] File: src/services/export/code-generator-utils.ts (NEW)
  - Action: Extract common code generation utilities
  - Why: Reduce duplication in generateD3JavaScript and generateD3TypeScript
  - Extract:
    - Header generation (lines 37-58 pattern)
    - Import generation patterns
    - Common formatting utilities (toPascalCase already exists)

- [ ] File: src/services/export/code-generator.ts
  - Action: Refactor to use extracted utilities
  - Why: DRY, easier to maintain code generation logic

### Phase 3: Improve Separation of Concerns

#### 3.1: Split large composables
**Problem**: Some composables have grown too large with multiple responsibilities

- [ ] File: src/composables/useTerritoryTransforms.ts (current: ~280 lines)
  - Action: Split into focused composables:
    - useTerritoryTransforms.ts - Core transform logic (projections, translations, scales)
    - useTerritoryProjections.ts - Projection selection logic
    - useTerritoryState.ts - Territory state management
  - Why: Better separation of concerns, easier testing and maintenance

#### 3.2: Extract view orchestration logic from useViewState
**Problem**: useViewState mixes simple flags with complex orchestration

- [ ] File: src/composables/useViewState.ts (current: 205 lines)
  - Action: Keep only simple view mode flags and card UI helpers
  - Move: ViewOrchestrationService integration to separate composable
  - New: src/composables/useViewOrchestration.ts
  - Why: Single responsibility principle, clearer API

#### 3.3: Consolidate store initialization patterns
**Problem**: Multiple stores have different initialization patterns
**Files**: src/stores/config.ts, src/stores/geoData.ts, src/stores/parameters.ts

- [ ] Create: src/stores/utils/store-initialization.ts
  - Action: Extract common initialization patterns
  - Why: Consistent initialization across stores
  - Include:
    - Async initialization wrapper
    - Loading state management
    - Error handling patterns

### Phase 4: Refactor Complex Components

#### 4.1: Simplify MapRenderer.vue
**Problem**: MapRenderer has multiple concerns (rendering, interactions, watchers)
**File**: src/components/MapRenderer.vue (387 lines)

- [ ] Action: Already well-factored with composables, but could extract:
  - Render coordination logic to useMapRendering.ts
  - Cursor management to useCursorManagement.ts
  - Why: Component focuses on template/DOM, composables handle logic

#### 4.2: Simplify TerritoryControls.vue
**Problem**: Large component with multiple sub-sections
**File**: src/components/TerritoryControls.vue (252 lines)

- [ ] Action: Already uses useTerritoryTransforms, consider extracting:
  - Preset divergence checking to separate composable
  - Projection family logic to utility function
  - Why: Reduce component complexity

#### 4.3: Extract config store logic
**Problem**: config.ts is very large (738 lines) with multiple concerns
**File**: src/stores/config.ts

- [ ] Action: Split into focused stores/modules:
  - config.ts - Core configuration (atlas, view mode, territory mode)
  - projectionConfig.ts - Projection-specific configuration
  - viewPresetConfig.ts - View preset management
  - Why: Single responsibility, easier to maintain and test

### Phase 5: Improve Type Safety and Validation

#### 5.1: Consolidate type definitions
**Problem**: Some types are duplicated or scattered

- [ ] Action: Audit and consolidate:
  - Territory types (multiple definitions)
  - ViewState/ViewMode types
  - Parameter types
  - Why: Single source of truth, reduce duplication

#### 5.2: Add runtime validation where missing
- [ ] Files: Services that accept external input
  - Action: Add validation for PresetLoader, CompositeImportService inputs
  - Why: Better error messages, fail fast

### Phase 6: Performance Optimizations

#### 6.1: Reduce computed property recalculations
**Problem**: Some computed properties in stores may recalculate unnecessarily

- [ ] File: src/stores/config.ts
  - Action: Audit computed properties for proper dependency tracking
  - Focus: effectiveProjectionParams (lines 259-278)
  - Why: Performance improvement

#### 6.2: Optimize watchers
**Problem**: Multiple watchers trigger on atlas change

- [ ] File: src/stores/config.ts
  - Action: Consolidate overlapping watchers (lines 561-600+)
  - Why: Reduce redundant updates, improve performance

### Phase 7: Documentation and Testing

#### 7.1: Update documentation after refactoring
- [x] Files to update:
  - docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt - Updated composables section
  - docs/architecture.llm.txt - Updated composable count and test coverage
  - Why: Keep documentation in sync with code
  - Completed: Documentation updated to reflect useAtlasConfig and useParameterProvider composables

#### 7.2: Add missing tests for new composables
- [x] Action: Add tests for newly extracted composables:
  - useAtlasConfig.spec.ts (created with 6 tests)
  - useParameterProvider.spec.ts (created with 5 tests)
  - Why: Maintain test coverage for new utilities
  - Completed: Basic test coverage added, ready for expansion

### Phase 8: Code Style and Consistency

#### 8.1: Standardize error handling
**Problem**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across services

- [ ] Action: Create error handling utilities
  - File: src/utils/error-handling.ts
  - Standardize console.error, console.warn usage
  - Why: Consistent error reporting

#### 8.2: Standardize service patterns
**Problem**: Mix of instance and static services, some inconsistent

- [ ] Action: Document and enforce service patterns
  - Review each service against pattern decision guide
  - Convert where appropriate
  - Why: Consistent architecture
