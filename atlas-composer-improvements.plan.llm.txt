# Atlas Composer - Architectural Analysis & Improvement Plan

## Objective
Maximize Atlas Composer's value proposition through targeted improvements in architecture, user experience, performance, and maintainability while keeping complexity and code length manageable.

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
1. **Clean Architecture**: Well-organized service layer with clear domain boundaries
2. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage (100% type check passing)
3. **Test Coverage**: 251 tests passing (100% success rate)
4. **Modern Stack**: Vue 3 Composition API, Pinia, Observable Plot, D3.js
5. **Export System**: Zero-dependency projection loader with plugin architecture
6. **Documentation**: Excellent LLM-optimized documentation system
7. **Configuration-Driven**: JSON-based atlas system with validation

### Current Metrics
- Total Lines: ~20,761 (TS + Vue)
- Components: 35 Vue components
- Services: 28 TypeScript files
- Composables: 11 composition functions
- Stores: 4 Pinia stores
- Atlases: 6 configurations (France, Portugal, Spain, EU, USA, World)
- Projections: 20+ with smart recommendations
- Test Files: 13 test suites, 251 tests

### Areas for Improvement

#### 1. Value Proposition Enhancement
**Current**: Tool for creating composite projections
**Opportunity**: Position as complete cartography toolkit with multiple use cases

#### 2. User Experience Gaps
- Undo/redo functionality for projection adjustments [PRIORITY: LOW - marked as really secondary]
- Limited preset/template system for common configurations [NEEDS INVESTIGATION - see details below]

#### 3. Performance Opportunities
**Note: All items require detailed investigation and benchmarking before implementation**

- Large files: composite-projection.ts (618 lines), code-generator.ts (435 lines)
  * Analysis needed: Are these files actually problematic or just naturally comprehensive?
  * Impact assessment: Would splitting improve maintainability or just scatter related logic?
  
- Virtual scrolling for territory lists in split view
  * Current state: How many territories are typically displayed? Is scrolling actually slow?
  * Threshold: Only needed if performance degrades with >50 territories
  
- Lazy loading for projection definitions
  * Analysis needed: Current bundle size and projection data weight
  * Benefit verification: Measure actual load time improvement
  
- Memoization for expensive projection calculations
  * Profiling required: Identify actual performance bottlenecks first
  * ROI assessment: Are calculations truly expensive or fast enough?

#### 4. Code Organization
**Note: All items require detailed audit before refactoring**

- Service patterns standardization
  * Audit needed: Identify which services use instance vs static patterns
  * Decision criteria: When is instance pattern beneficial vs static?
  * Risk: Unnecessary refactoring could introduce bugs without clear benefit
  
- File naming conventions
  * Investigation needed: Document current naming patterns (camelCase vs kebab-case)
  * Consistency check: Are there actual inconsistencies or just different domains?
  * Standard proposal: Define convention for new files
  
- Test file organization
  * Analysis needed: What inconsistencies exist? Co-located vs separate __tests__?
  * Current coverage: 251 tests, 100% passing - don't break what works
  
- Export/import service duplication
  * Code review needed: Identify specific duplicated logic
  * Refactoring opportunity: Can shared logic be extracted without over-abstracting?

#### 5. Feature Gaps

- Shareable URLs with state [STATUS: IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS VERIFICATION]
  * Implementation: useUrlState composable, ShareButton component, i18n support ✓
  * Issue: User reports "not really working yet" - needs investigation
  * Testing needed: Verify state serialization/deserialization works correctly
  * Potential issues: Timing of state restoration, missing parameters, URL length limits?
  
- Batch operations for territories
  * Use case clarification needed: What operations? (scale, translate, projection change?)
  * Scope: Apply to all territories vs region-specific vs manual selection
  * UX design: How should users select territories for batch operations?
  
- Export styling customization
  * Current state: Export generates D3/Plot code with default styling
  * Requirements: What styling options? (colors, stroke width, labels?)
  * Complexity assessment: How much configuration without overwhelming users?
  
- External mapping service integration
  * Services in scope: Leaflet? Mapbox? Google Maps? OpenLayers?
  * Value proposition: What would this enable that export doesn't provide?
  * Maintenance burden: APIs change, requires ongoing updates

#### 6. Documentation Gaps

- User-facing documentation
  * Audience: End users vs developers using exported code?
  * Format: In-app help, external wiki, video tutorials?
  * Priority assessment: Is lack of docs actually blocking users?
  * Quick wins: Tooltips, help icons, better placeholder text
  
- Migration guides for major versions
  * Current state: What breaking changes exist between versions?
  * Necessity: Is there a user base that needs migration support?
  * Timing: Premature if version 1.0 not yet released

## Affected Domains
- [ ] Vue Architecture (docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt) - UX improvements, new components
- [ ] Services (docs/services.llm.txt) - Service layer refactoring
- [ ] Export System (docs/export.llm.txt) - Enhanced export features
- [ ] Atlas System (docs/atlases.llm.txt) - Preset system
- [ ] Architecture (docs/architecture.llm.txt) - Overall structural changes

## Context
- Architecture: docs/architecture.llm.txt
- Vue Layer: docs/vue-architecture.llm.txt
- Services: docs/services.llm.txt
- Export System: docs/export.llm.txt
- Projections: docs/projections.llm.txt

## Investigation Required: Shareable URLs Feature

**User Feedback**: "already started, cool idea, not really working yet"

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED** ✓

### Root Cause
The URL serialization was including ALL territory settings (scales, translations) for atlases like France, even when they were at their atlas-specific default values. This created extremely long URLs:

- France has 12 overseas territories with default positioning
- Each territory: 2 translations (x, y) + 1 scale = 36 parameters
- URL became ~800+ characters even with default settings
- URLs could exceed browser limits (2048 chars) with custom adjustments

### The Fix
Modified `useUrlState.ts` to compare territory settings against **atlas-specific defaults** rather than absolute defaults (1.0 for scale, 0 for translations):

```typescript
// Before: Compared to absolute defaults
if (scale !== 1) { /* serialize */ }

// After: Compare to atlas-specific defaults  
const defaultScale = defaults.scales[code] ?? 1
if (scale !== defaultScale) { /* serialize */ }
```

**Benefits**:
- URLs only include CHANGED settings, not all settings
- Typical URLs now ~100-200 characters (manageable)
- No data loss - defaults are restored automatically by atlas initialization
- Better user experience with shorter, cleaner URLs

### Testing Added
- Created comprehensive test suite: 17 tests for useUrlState
- All tests pass (268/268 total tests)
- Tests cover:
  - Basic serialization/deserialization
  - Atlas-specific default handling
  - Round-trip state preservation
  - Edge cases (malformed data, partial config)

### Remaining Validation
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing: Complex configs with territory adjustments
- [ ] Verify URL restoration works correctly on page load
- [ ] Test with all atlases (France, Portugal, Spain, EU, USA, World)
- [ ] Verify URL length stays under limits even with max customization

#### 5.3 Naming Convention Standardization
**Status**: DOCUMENT FIRST
- [ ] Document current naming conventions
- [ ] Identify actual inconsistencies (not just preferences)
- [ ] Propose guidelines for new code
- [ ] Refactor only if causing confusion

### Priority 6: Extended Features (Low Priority / Nice to Have)

#### 6.1 Batch Territory Operations
**Status**: NEEDS USE CASE VALIDATION
- Requires detailed requirements before implementation
- See "Feature Gaps" section for investigation points

#### 6.2 Enhanced Export Options
**Status**: NEEDS REQUIREMENTS
- Requires user research: What formats are actually needed?

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Requires profiling FIRST
   - Don't optimize without measuring
   - May not be needed at all

5. **Code Organization Improvements**
   - Need audit to identify actual issues
   - Current code is working well (251 tests passing)
