  - Content: Theme management, display toggles (graticule, sphere, borders, limits)
  - Result: 68 lines created - Clean separation of UI concerns
  - Status: COMPLETE - New store created with theme and display options
  
- [x] File: src/stores/territory.ts
  - Action: Extract territory state
  - Why: Separate territory configuration concerns from main config
  - Content: Territory projections, translations, scales with initialization

  - Migration: Bridge pattern → component updates → composable updates → bridge removal → localStorage migration
  - Files Updated: MapRenderer.vue, DisplayOptionsSection.vue, ThemeSelector.vue, useTerritoryTransforms.ts, useProjectionConfig.ts

### Phase 7: Improve Type Safety
Add stronger typing throughout Vue layer.

- [ ] File: src/types/vue-props.ts

- [ ] File: src/types/composables.ts
  - Action: Create composable return types
  - Why: Type-safe composable interfaces
  - Content: LoadingState, ProjectionConfig, TerritoryConfig, etc.

### Phase 8: Add Component Tests
Establish testing foundation for refactored components.

- [ ] File: src/components/__tests__/MapRenderer.spec.ts
  - Action: Add unit tests for MapRenderer
  - Why: Ensure rendering logic correctness
  
- [ ] File: src/composables/__tests__/useProjectionConfig.spec.ts

- Clear single responsibility
- Easy to locate and modify code
- Reduced cognitive load

### Testability
- Isolated composables can be unit tested
- Components can be tested with mocked composables
- Clear boundaries for testing
- Better test coverage

### Reusability
- Composables can be used across components
- Configuration sections can be reused
- View components can be used independently
- Consistent patterns

### Performance

- Lazy loading opportunities
- Optimized reactivity with focused state
- Better change detection

### Developer Experience
- Clear file structure
- Easy to onboard new developers

## Migration Strategy

### Incremental Approach
1. Create new components/composables alongside existing
2. Test new components in isolation
3. Switch MapView to use new components one at a time
4. Remove old code after verification
5. Update documentation as we go

### Rollback Plan
- Keep old MapView as MapView.legacy.vue during migration
- Feature flag to switch between old and new
- Can revert quickly if issues found

### Timeline Estimate
- Phase 1-2: 2-3 hours (component extraction)
- Phase 3-4: 2-3 hours (composables)
- Phase 5: 1-2 hours (props simplification)
- Phase 6: 1-2 hours (store reorganization)
- Phase 7: 1 hour (type safety)
- Phase 8: 2-3 hours (testing)
- Documentation: 1 hour
- **Total: 10-15 hours**
